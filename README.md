- This is the front end test build with react, next framework, typescript. And there is also a backend server build with node.js and express.
- To start the project install npm packages in my-app and server folders
- Start front end app with npm run dev in my-app folder and npm run start in server folder
- API authentication/authorization implementationis not done because it has to be done with session management on the server and since this is a front end test i thought its not necessary to waste time on it.
